# Tiptap templates
This repository provides exemplary UI templates for those looking to get a headstart with the Tiptap Editor in a React environment… Who said headless can't be helpful?
With these templates, you can quickly bootstrap your project with a well-designed, functional user interface for your Tiptap Editor.

## How to use templates

Clone the repository and copy the template you want to use manually. For a list of all available templates see below.

> [!Important]
> For users without access to Tiptap's paid [Content AI](https://tiptap.dev/product/content-ai) features, you will need to remove or exclude the Content AI extensions from these templates. These templates are designed to showcase UI possibilities and should be adapted to fit your project's requirements and access to [Tiptap features](https://tiptap.dev/pricing).
