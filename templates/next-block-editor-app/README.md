This command clones the entire repository, providing access to all the Tiptap templates currently available. The block
editor template is located in `templates/next-block-editor-app`.

Proceed with the following steps:

```bash
# Duplicate the example environment file and adjust the necessary settings in the .env file
# Ensure the inclusion of your Tiptap cloud token and application IDs in the .env file
cp .env.example .env

npm install

# Launch the development server
npm run dev

# Access the application at http://localhost:3000
```

> [!Important]
> For users without access to Tiptap's paid [Content AI](https://tiptap.dev/product/content-ai) features, you will need to remove or exclude the Content AI extension from this template. This template is designed to showcase UI possibilities and should be adapted to fit your project's requirements and access to [Tiptap features](https://tiptap.dev/pricing).


## Usage Guidelines

The BlockEditor template is a fully functional Next.js application, akin to Notion or Dropbox Paper, suitable as a
foundation for your projects or as a base for a custom editor.

Key features of the template include:

- A Next.js setup with TypeScript
- A basic Tailwind setup for styling
- Pre-configured links to Tiptap Cloud for collaboration and data persistence.
- A Block Editor with a basic set of nodes and marks but also more advanced features like
  - Drag & Drop via a DragHandle
  - A fleshed out menu bar for text editing and formatting
  - Link editing
  - mocked image uploading that can be hooked up to your backend

You can either start a fresh project from this editor or copy over the editor or parts you need to your own projects.
Make sure to check out the [Tiptap documentation](https://tiptap.dev) for more information on how to use Tiptap.
